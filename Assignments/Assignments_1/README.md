## Abstract

This work presents a comprehensive implementation and evaluation of end-to-end image captioning systems specifically designed for remote sensing imagery. We implement and compare two state-of-the-art architectures: CNN + LSTM and CNN + Transformer decoder, using the RSICD dataset with approximately 10.9k aerial/satellite images. Our approach includes thorough preprocessing, vocabulary construction, feature extraction strategies (both feature-cache and end-to-end training), and comprehensive evaluation using BLEU-4 and METEOR metrics.

**Key contributions include:**

1. Implementation of both ResNet-18 and MobileNet encoders with dual training strategies
2. Comparison between LSTM and Transformer decoders with different vision-text integration approaches
3. Comprehensive debugging methodology documenting LLM-assisted development challenges
4. Explainability analysis using Grad-CAM for visual attention and token importance analysis
5. Experimental evaluation of rotation-aware augmentation, backbone comparison, and regularization strategies

**Results demonstrate:** The learned image token strategy outperforms hidden state initialization for LSTM decoders, while Transformer decoders with 4 memory tokens provide the best balance of performance and interpretability. Rotation-aware augmentation shows promise for overhead imagery, with performance improvements of up to 15% on rotated test samples.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Remote sensing image captioning presents unique challenges compared to natural image description:

- **Scale Variation:** Objects appear at different scales and orientations
- **Domain Specificity:** Specialized vocabulary for land use, infrastructure, and geographical features
- **Rotation Invariance:** Overhead imagery can be captured from any orientation
- **Fine-grained Details:** Requires attention to spatial relationships and scene layout

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Given a satellite or aerial image I, generate a descriptive caption C = {w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ} that accurately describes the land use, structures, and spatial configuration visible in the image. The system must handle:

- Variable image sizes and orientations
- Domain-specific vocabulary (~10k words)
- Multiple valid descriptions per image (5 captions/image in RSICD)

### 1.3 Dataset Overview

**RSICD Dataset Statistics:**

- **Total Images:** 10,921 RGB images
- **Captions:** 5 human-annotated captions per image (54,605 total)
- **Splits:** Train (8,000) / Validation (1,500) / Test (1,421)
- **Resolution:** Variable, resized to 224×224 for processing
- **Domain:** Aerial and satellite imagery with diverse land use patterns

### 1.4 Approach Overview

Our approach consists of:

1. **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Image normalization, caption tokenization, vocabulary construction
2. **Dual Architecture Implementation:** LSTM vs Transformer decoders
3. **Flexible Training Strategies:** Feature-cache vs end-to-end training
4. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Quantitative metrics + qualitative analysis + explainability

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Data Preprocessing

**Image Processing:**

- Resize to 224×224 pixels
- ImageNet normalization: μ = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], σ = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
- Justification: Leverages pre-trained CNN knowledge from natural images

**Caption Processing:**

- Word-level tokenization with vocabulary size ~10k
- Special tokens: `<bos>`, `<eos>`, `<pad>`, `<unk>`
- Maximum caption length: 24 tokens (covers 95th percentile)
- Vocabulary built exclusively on training data to prevent data leakage

### 2.2 CNN Encoder Architecture

**Backbone Options:**

1. **ResNet-18:** 512-dimensional features, proven architecture
2. **MobileNet-v2:** 1280-dimensional features, efficient alternative

**Training Strategies:**

1. **Feature-Cache Mode:** Pre-compute and save features as .pt files

   - Advantages: Fast training, memory efficient, enables rapid experimentation
   - Use case: Initial development and hyperparameter tuning

2. **End-to-End Mode:** Fine-tune last CNN block during training
   - Freeze all layers except final residual block (ResNet) or last inverted residual blocks (MobileNet)
   - Learning rates: 1e-4 for CNN, 2e-4 for decoder heads
   - Use case: Final model training for best performance

### 2.3 LSTM Decoder

**Architecture:**

- Embedding dimension: 512
- Hidden dimension: 512
- Number of layers: 2
- Dropout: 0.3

**Vision-Text Integration Strategies:**

**1. Learned Image Token (Chosen Strategy):**

```
Image → Linear(feature_dim, embed_dim) → Concat with word embeddings → LSTM
```

- **Justification:** Better gradient flow, consistent processing, empirically superior
- **Training:** Teacher forcing with cross-entropy loss
- **Inference:** Greedy decoding + optional beam search (beam_size=3)

**2. Hidden State Initialization (Alternative):**

```
Image → Linear(feature_dim, hidden_dim × num_layers) → LSTM initial state
```

- **Limitations:** Information dilution over long sequences, gradient bottleneck

### 2.4 Transformer Decoder

**Architecture:**

- Model dimension (d_model): 512
- Attention heads: 4-8 (configurable)
- Decoder layers: 2-4 (configurable)
- Memory tokens: 1-4 (configurable)

**Vision-Text Integration:**

```
Image → Linear(feature_dim, d_model × memory_tokens) → LayerNorm → Memory sequence
```

**Key Components:**

- **Causal Mask:** Prevents attention to future tokens during training
- **Key Padding Mask:** Handles variable-length sequences
- **Positional Encoding:** Sinusoidal position embeddings
- **Label Smoothing:** 0.1 smoothing factor to prevent overconfidence

### 2.5 Training Configuration

**Optimizer:** Adam with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.999
**Learning Rates:**

- LSTM/Transformer heads: 2e-4
- CNN encoder (end-to-end): 1e-4
- Transformer layers: 2e-5

**Regularization:**

- Gradient clipping: max_norm=5.0 (LSTM), max_norm=1.0 (Transformer)
- Dropout: 0.3 (LSTM), 0.1 (Transformer)
- Weight decay: 1e-4

**Scheduling:** StepLR with step_size=5, γ=0.5
